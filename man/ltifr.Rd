\title{LTI frequency response kernel}
\usage{
ltifr(A, B, w)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{State-space matrix, A}

\item{B}{State-space matrix, B. B must have as many rows as the matrix A.}
}
\value{
Returns the frequency response in vector. \code{\link{freqresp}} utilizes this function.
}
\description{
This function computes the frequency
response of the following system:

   g(w) = (wI-A) \ B

for the complex frequencies contained in the vector W. The column
vector B must have as many rows as the matrix A.
